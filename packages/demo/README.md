# @richie-rpc/demo

Demo and integration testing package for the Richie RPC library.

## Overview

This package demonstrates a complete working example of the Richie RPC library with:

- ✅ Contract definition with Zod schemas
- ✅ Server implementation with Bun.serve
- ✅ OpenAPI spec generation and serving
- ✅ Scalar API documentation UI
- ✅ Typesafe client usage
- ✅ Full CRUD operations
- ✅ Request/response validation
- ✅ Playwright E2E tests

## Running the Demo

### Start the server

```bash
bun run start
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:3000` with:

- API endpoints at `/users`
- OpenAPI spec at `/openapi.json`
- API documentation UI at `/docs`

### Test the client

In a separate terminal:

```bash
bun run client-test.ts
```

This will run through a series of client integration tests demonstrating:

1. Listing users
2. Getting a specific user
3. Creating a new user
4. Updating a user
5. Deleting a user
6. Error handling (404s)
7. Validation errors

### Run E2E tests

```bash
bun run test:e2e
```

This will run Playwright tests that:

- Verify OpenAPI spec is served correctly
- Test the Scalar documentation UI
- Perform full CRUD operations via HTTP
- Test validation errors
- Test error responses

## API Endpoints

### GET /users
List all users with optional pagination.

Query parameters:
- `limit` (optional): Number of users to return
- `offset` (optional): Offset for pagination

### GET /users/:id
Get a specific user by ID.

### POST /users
Create a new user.

Body:
```json
{
  "name": "string",
  "email": "string (email format)",
  "age": "number (optional)"
}
```

### PUT /users/:id
Update a user.

Body:
```json
{
  "name": "string (optional)",
  "email": "string (optional, email format)",
  "age": "number (optional)"
}
```

### DELETE /users/:id
Delete a user.

## Project Structure

- `contract.ts` - API contract definition with Zod schemas
- `server.ts` - Server implementation with handlers
- `client-test.ts` - Client integration tests
- `tests/api.spec.ts` - Playwright E2E tests
- `playwright.config.ts` - Playwright configuration

## Success Criteria ✅

All success criteria from the plan are met:

- ✅ Contract defined in @richie-rpc/core with typed endpoints
- ✅ Server handlers implemented and running on Bun.serve
- ✅ OpenAPI spec accessible at `/openapi.json`
- ✅ Scalar API documentation UI served at `/docs`
- ✅ Client can make typesafe requests to server
- ✅ Responses are validated and correctly typed
- ✅ Validation errors thrown for invalid data
- ✅ All packages work together in demo
- ✅ Playwright test successfully navigates to `/docs` and tests endpoints
- ✅ Zero runtime errors in demo integration test
